# Tusubtitulo.com subtitle downloader (Unofficial)
This is an unofficial and simple downloader for Tusubtitulo.com subtitles. The site is mainly focused on spanish subtitles and it's users quickly create new subs within the day of an episode being aired.
The series information is provided by TVdb's API and the aplication uses urllib paired with lxml to navigate Tusubtitulo.com and interpret the data.
If for any reason you would like to contribute with a donation head to [Tusubtitulo.com](https://Tusubtitulo.com/) and do so there since I do not accept money.
#Kodi addon
I'm also trying to develop a subtitles service addon for Kodi but so far I have been unable to understand the inner workings of such services so if you can and want to help with that feel free to do so.
